    "\n",
    "This lab is a tutorial on belief propagation, one of the many approaches for solving graphical models. The actual goal is to build a model for identifying faults with coffee machines. You're given a graphical model of how a coffee machine works, that connects observations to possible failure modes. Belief propagation is then used to calculate the probability of each failure (marginal probability) given the available evidence (observations). This is broken up as:\n",
    "1. Given the graphical model for the state of a coffee machine learn the distributions from data. This is basic (Bayesian) statistics.\n",
    "2. Implement belief propagation, so you can evaluate the probability of each failure given the available evidence. This is broken down into a number of steps:\n",
    "    1. Conversion from _Bayes net_ to _factor_graph_, as BP is simplest to implement using the later. A factor graph is described in the slides, but is a bipartite graph of factors and random variables.\n",
    "    2. Belief propagation works by passing messages along the edges of a factor graph. Each message depends on other messages having already been sent, so the second step is to work out a valid order to send messages in.\n",
    "    3. Now you need to pass the messages, by implementing two functions: One to pass a message from a RV (random variable) to a factors, and another to pass a message from a factor to a RV.\n",
    "    4. Finally, the above two steps let you pass all of the messages and extract the final belief. There is an extra complication to handle observed random variables. This has been coded for you.\n",
    "3. Identify the most probable failure for a set of broken coffee machines. No marks here, just lets you try the algorithm out!"

    "## Coffee Machine Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For if you are unfamiliar with an espresso coffee machine here is a brief description of how one works (you can ignore this):\n",
    "> The user puts ground coffee into a portafilter (round container with a handle and two spouts at the bottom), tamps it (compacts the coffee down), and clamps the portafilter into the group head at the front of the machine. A gasket (rubber ring) forms a seal between the portafilter and group head. A button is pressed. Water is drawn from a reservoir by a pump into a boiler. In the boiler a heating element raises the waters temperature, before the pump pushes it through the group head and into the portafilter at high pressure. The water is forced through the coffee grinds and makes a tasty espresso.\n",

    "Note that while the model is close to what you may guess the probabilities are not absolute, to account for mistakes and unknown failures. For instance, the mechanic may make a mistake while brewing an espresso and erroneously conclude that the machine is broken when it is in fact awesome. The probabilities associated with each failure are not uniform. The data set is roughly $50:50$ between failed/working machines, which is hardly realistic for a real product, but makes this exercise simpler as it avoids the problem of extremely rare failure modes."

    "## 3. Message Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Belief propagation works by passing messages over the edges of the factor graph, two messages per edge as there is one in each direction. A message can only be sent from node `a` to node `b` when node `a` has received all of it's messages, __except__ for the message from node `b` to node `a`, which is not needed for that calculation. For this reason we need to convert the list of edges into a list of messages to send, ordered such that the previous constraint is never violated. Note that this naturally involves doubling the number of items in the list as we now have two entries per edge, one per direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to solve this problem and you're welcome to choose any (the below is not the best), but here is a description of an approach that works by simulating message passing where constraints are checked: Generate a list of messages to send (the edges plus the edges with the tuples reversed, to cover both directions) and an empty list, which will ultimately contain the messages in the order they were sent. The algorithm then proceeds by identifying messages in the first list for which the constraint has been satisfied and then moving them to the end of the second list, indicating the message has been sent. This is repeated until the first list is empty and the second full; the second will be in a valid message sending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented badly the above is both horrifically slow and fiddly to code. One technique to make it faster is to _bounce_ — instead of going through the list of messages to send in the same order each time you go forwards and then backwards and then forwards etc. This avoids the scenario where the to send list contains the messages in reverse sending order, such that with each loop you only find one more message that you can send, meaning you have to loop as many times as there are messages. A second technique also makes the code much simpler. Figuring out if you can send a message when the lists are represented as lists is slow — you have to loop both. Instead, convert the lists into a pair of nested dictionaries indexed `[message destination][message source]` (order is important!) that contains `True` if the message has been sent (in second list), `False` if it has not (in first list). It's now simple to check if a message can be sent or not; you will still need to generate the list of messages to send as you flip values from `False` to `True` (make sure you get the order right — the dictionaries are indexed backwards).\n",

    "Hint:\n",
    "* When converting from edges to dictionaries of flags `defaultdict(dict)` may simplify.\n",
    "* `all(v for v in thing if <condition>)` is valid Python, that returns `True` only if `v` is `True` for every instance that passes the condition.\n",

This equation is exactly what you need to evaluate in `send_rv()`. An almost identical equation is the _belief_, that is the marginal distribution of a RV and the final output of the algorithm:\n",

The key detail is that this is no longer simple multiplication: Each message is over a different RV (the RV of its source) and hence needs to be multiplied in the correct way. A typical recipe for this is:\n",
